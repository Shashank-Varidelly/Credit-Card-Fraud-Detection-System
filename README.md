#### 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection System 💳🔍

A Machine Learning system to detect suspicious credit card transactions quickly and accurately, helping mitigate financial losses caused by fraud.

💡 Project Overview

Fraudulent activities in financial systems cause billions in losses every year. Detecting them in real time is challenging due to large volumes of data and constantly evolving fraud patterns. This project builds a robust system to identify potential fraud using machine learning techniques.

🧰 Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared raw transaction data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered patterns and trends in fraudulent transactions.

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Model Evaluation: Compared metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to select the best-performing model.

Optimized for Large Datasets: Efficient handling of high-volume transaction data.

🔑 Key Takeaways

Data preprocessing is as critical as model selection.

Ensemble models like Random Forest & XGBoost improve detection accuracy.

Balancing precision and recall reduces false positives in fraud detection.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
